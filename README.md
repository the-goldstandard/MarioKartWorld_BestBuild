Overview:

This project uses Queueing Theory to find the optimal character-vehicle combination for 150cc races in Mario Kart World. It calculates the probabilities of possessing different numbers of coins during a race and evaluates the expected overall speed of every possible combination. The model accounts for:

- Speed increases from terrain-specific speed attributes
- The effects of the weight attribute on how the combination's speed responds to coins
- The effects of the acceleration attribute on drift and trick boost durations

Findings:

- A flyweight character (i.e. Swoop, Para-Biddybud, Baby Peach, or Baby Daisy) with the Baby Blopper was found to be the best combination.
- Other viable combinations widely feature solid-terrain-focused featherweight (i.e. Spike, Goomba, or Baby Mario) and lightweight (i.e. Nabbit or Toadette) characters and the Mach Rocket and R.O.B. H.O.G..
- The flyweight character with the W-Twin Chopper is an exception at second-best.

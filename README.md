Overview:

This project uses Queueing Theory to find the optimal character-vehicle combinations for 150cc races in Mario Kart World. It calculates the probabilities of possessing different numbers of coins during a race and evaluates the expected overall speed of every possible combination. The model accounts for:

- Speed increases from terrain-specific speed attributes
- The effects of the weight attribute on how the combination's speed responds to coins
- The effects of the acceleration attribute on drift and trick boost durations and the zero-to-top-speed duration

Findings:

- There are two distinct dominant strategies for the optimal character-vehicle combinations for 150cc races in Mario Kart World
- The first dominant strategy is to maximise the speed attribute on solid terrain using a solid-focused heavyweight character (i.e. Wario or Wriggler) with the Reel Racer to maximise progress while the racer is uninterrupted
- The second dominant strategy is to rely on faster recovery when necessary and higher speed increases at the middling numbers of coins in possession to enhance the racerâ€™s overall expected speed
- Mario Kart World players may may choose either of the two dominant strategies according to their preferred approach to the game and see similar success
